# Slovs

This application is designed to memorize English words.

## Usage

1. Add dictionary-file to your working directory `name_file.json`:
```
{
	"in case of": "в случае",
	"public": "публичный",
	"only": "только"
}
```

2. Create an environment variable `export SLOVSFILE='name_file.json'` containing the path to dictionary-file.
3. To run the program, enter `python3 main.py` into the console.

_You can also override the file path in an environment variable using `-f` flag: `python3 main.py -f name_file.json`_
